            <h4>who is Pink</h4>
            <p class="intro">Alecia Beth Moore (born September 8, 1979), known professionally as Pink (stylized as
                P!nk), is an American singer and songwriter.
                She was originally a member of the girl group Choice. In 1995, LaFace Records saw potential in Pink and
                offered her a solo
                recording contract. Her R&B-influenced debut studio album Can't Take Me Home (2000) was certified
                double-platinum in the
                United States and spawned two Billboard Hot 100 top-ten songs: "There You Go" and "Most Girls". She
                gained further
                recognition with the collaborative single "Lady Marmalade" from the Moulin Rouge! soundtrack, which
                topped many charts
                worldwide. Refocusing her sound to pop rock with her second studio album Missundaztood (2001), the album
                sold more than
                13 million copies worldwide and yielded the international number-one songs "Get the Party Started",
                "Don't Let Me Get Me",
                and "Just Like a Pill".</p>

            <h4>Her career</h4>
            <p class="career">While Pink's third studio album, Try This (2003), sold significantly less than her
                previous work, it earned her the Grammy
                Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. She returned to the top of record charts with her fourth
                and fifth studio albums
                , I'm Not Dead (2006) and Funhouse (2008), which spawned the top-ten entries "Who Knew" and "U + Ur
                Hand", as well as the
                number-one single "So What". Pink's sixth studio album, The Truth About Love (2012), was her first
                Billboard 200 number-one
                album and spawned her fourth US number-one single, "Just Give Me a Reason". In 2014, Pink recorded a
                collaborative album,
                Rose Ave., with Canadian musician Dallas Green under a folk music duo named You+Me. Her next studio
                albums, Beautiful
                Trauma (2017) and Hurts 2B Human (2019), both debuted at atop the Billboard 200 chart, with the former
                becoming the
                world's third best-selling album of the year.</p>

            <h4>Public Image</h4>
            <p class="publicimg">Pink is involved with several charities, including Human Rights Campaign, ONE Campaign,
                The Prince's Trust,
                New York Restoration Project, Run for the Cure Foundation, Save the Children, Take Back the Night,
                UNICEF and
                World Animal Protection.[164] As of May 2008, Pink has been officially recognized as an advocate for
                RSPCA Australia.
                On February 16, 2009, Pink announced she was donating $250,000 to the Red Cross Bushfire Appeal to aid
                the victims
                of the bushfires that swept through the Australian state of Victoria earlier that month.[165] Pink
                stated that she
                wanted to make "a tangible expression of support".[166] Pink also donated money to Autism Speaks.[167]
                In July
                2021 she offered to pay the fines handed out to the Norwegian women's beach handball team, after they
                wore shorts
                like their male counterparts instead of bikini bottoms.</p>
